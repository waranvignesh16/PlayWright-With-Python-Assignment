Hello guys, Artificial Intelligence has moved far beyond being just a buzzword. In 2025, companies across every industry are racing to adopt AI and generative AI (Gen AI) solutions to stay competitive.

As a result, system design for Machine Learning and AI-powered applications has become one of the most in-demand skills for software engineers, architects, and aspiring ML practitioners.

But learning how to design these systems effectively is not easy — there are scalability, latency, reliability, and ethical considerations at every step.

This is where ByteByteGo comes in. Known for simplifying complex technical concepts with crystal-clear visuals and practical explanations, ByteByteGo has built a strong reputation for helping engineers master system design.

But the big question is: is ByteByteGo a good place to learn Machine Learning and Gen AI system design in 2025?

Lately, ByteByteGo has set itself apart by offering comprehensive training rooted in NOT JUST one — but TWO best-selling books, covering both Machine Learning System Design and Generative AI System Design.
